# FPGA-Chip-Backend-Controller-Design-and-Verification
Designed and implemented a 7-state FSM backend controller in Verilog for startup sequencing, gain programming, and adaptive bias control. • Developed a 4-tap moving average filter for ADC outputs, smoothing noise and enabling stable control decisions. • Built an FPGA programming model to generate reset, serial clock, and configuration bits.
